# TODO:
# 1. Get a template starter here
# 2. Create a big file with account_channels and the proper high-level shared fields (like base, but for websockets)
# 3. Get account_channels request squared away
# 4. Get account_channels response
# 5. Do account_channels error response
# 6. Look into how to test AsyncAPI (since I don't know if redocly does - maybe it does!)

# Conceptually unique things to prototype
# Requests / responses
# Subscriptions
# Submit request (As it will have transaction types as a requirement)
